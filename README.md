# SignBridge: Bridging the Gap Through Sign Language and Inclusivity

SignBridge is an innovative AI-powered application designed to overcome communication barriers for India's deaf and hard-of-hearing community. By translating Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures into text—and vice versa—in real time, SignBridge empowers users to communicate seamlessly and promotes inclusivity.

## Overview

SignBridge addresses the gap in communication faced by the deaf community by providing a robust digital platform for real-time ISL translation. Traditional methods often overlook Indian Sign Language, leaving many without vital communication tools. Our solution leverages advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with L2 regularization, along with techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning, to deliver accurate gesture recognition and translation.

This project not only improves communication for the deaf but also aligns with key Sustainable Development Goals by reducing inequalities and enhancing inclusive education.

## Project Roadmap

**Phase 1 (0–4 Months): Proof-of-Concept & Prototype Development**  
- Develop the core CNN model with L2 regularization.  
- Integrate the ISLRTC dataset and conduct initial testing.  
- Gather early feedback from educators and community members.

**Phase 2 (4–8 Months): Pilot Testing & Iteration**  
- Deploy the prototype in select schools and community centers.  
- Refine features based on user feedback and real-world performance.  
- Initiate strategic partnership discussions with key stakeholders.

**Phase 3 (8–12 Months): Scaling & Commercialization**  
- Expand market reach by licensing the solution to educational institutions and government programs.  
- Enhance product features and add support for additional regional sign languages.  
- Launch targeted marketing and outreach campaigns.
